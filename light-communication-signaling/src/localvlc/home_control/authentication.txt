Authentication flow

1. Smartphone calls evaluateAuthentication at flask home control
2. Home control sends nonce and waits for response
3. Smartphone receives nonce, increment nonce and encrypts nonce using light token (flask light receiver)
4. Smartphone sends encrypted nonce to home control ((onGetEncryptedData)
5. Home control receives encrypted nonce, increment nonce, encrypt and compares encrypted nonce with
received encrypted nonce
